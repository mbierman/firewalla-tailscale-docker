- Fixed a bug in `install.sh` where the script would not run in interactive mode even when executed directly. The `while read` loop in the subnet discovery section was incorrectly redirecting standard input. Replaced it with a `for` loop to ensure correct interactive behavior.

- Refactored `install.sh` to address all `GEMINI` comments.
- `generate_docker_compose_yml` now uses the `$TAILSCALE_DATA_DIR` variable.
- `generate_tailscale_start` function is now self-contained and robust:
    - Includes `docker_compose_command` and `run_command` functions.
    - Accepts and uses `TEST_MODE`, `CONFIRM_MODE`, and `DUMMY_MODE` variables.
- Corrected argument passing to `generate_tailscale_start`.
- Removed duplicated code block in the start script section.
- Added a link to the GitHub project in the final instructions.
